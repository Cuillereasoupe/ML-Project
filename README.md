Hi!
This is my project's repository for the course Machine Learning in Earth and Environmental Sciences.

The meteodata.py and sentinel-images.py were used to gather and preprocess the useful data retrieved from the Datalakes platform (https://www.datalakes-eawag.ch/) and Sentinel-2 images. The google earth engine code used to download the images can be found under https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Fjonaswoodtli718%2Ftest1%3AML-LExplore.

These scripts produce the data.csv and satdata.csv files, which can be used for the main python script, main.py.

You can replicate my project from scratch by downloading the data, preprocessing it through the scripts cited above and obtain data.csv and satdata.csv to run main.py.
Alternatively, you can download the data.csv and satdata.csv and directly run the main.py with these.

Have a nice day!
